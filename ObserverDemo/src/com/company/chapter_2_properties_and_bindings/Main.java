    // Summary
    // - JavaFX properties and bindings hold values and fire events to attached listeners
    // - An invalidation event is fired when the value becomes invalid. And a change event is fired when the value is recomputed.
    // - Type-specific specializations of the generic key interface exits for boolean, int, long, float, double, String an Object types.
    // - Attaching ChangeListener to a property forces eager evaluation.
    // - New bindings can be created through directed extension, using factory methods in bindings, using fluent API
    // - Observable collections exits for List, Map, Set, and int and float arrays.
    // - The JavaFX Bean properties are defined by a getter, a setter, and property getter
    // - Java FX bean properties can be implemented through the eager instantiation, half-lazy instantiation, full-lazy instantiation strategies

    // Not Clear SelectionBonding
    // Using of Observable Collection or creating bindings is still limited.
